    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p id="our-story">Baker's Dozen started off as a small, one person stall in the Farmer's Market in 2017 to fill the need of sweet and high quality treats in the area. Since then, we've grown to have a team of 25 and have two locations in the area! We create beautiful desserts, including showstopping custom cakes for any occasion. We bake everything in store and hand decorate everything, ensuring that each bite will look and taste just as you dream it will. This is our passion! We hope to see you soon!</p>
